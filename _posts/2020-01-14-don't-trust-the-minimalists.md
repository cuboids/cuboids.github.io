<p>According to two people who call themselves "The Minimalists" we should buy the "Pakt Coffee Kit" (see <a href="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566510901/sltqcc7gewvbj9ux8hnx.png">here</a> for a picture). Let's wind back a bit. What do they mean with minimalism? From their website:</p>

<p><blockquote cite="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">
Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. . . .  Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.
</blockquote></p>  

<p>How wonderful! So you are telling me&mdash;an innocent deer ensnared in the trappings of consumer culture&mdash;that there is a way out? And this way out starts with paying $15 for your book on minimalism and $150 for an "on-the-go" coffee machine? I should mention that the Pakt Coffee Kit team includes a marketer, <i>the</i> job which perpetuates consumer culture. If that's not enough, the YouTube videos of the Minimalists include plenty of affiliate links (unlike <i>luminouscuboids</i>, see <a href="https://cuboids.page.link/cuboids">cuboids.page.link/cuboids</a>).</p>
  
<p>A bit further on, they write:</p>

<p><blockquote> What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say, <i>Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>That sounds great! Well, let me think. What's more meaningful, drinking a cup of coffee all alone, in unhappy, unfulfilled
isolation, or drinking with someone else, maybe a colleague or friend, or even a total stranger? I can see much more fulfillment in making new connections! How weird that the Pakt Coffee Kit can only make one cup of coffee at a time! I'm supposed to only care about myself? Is that what minimalism is about?</p>

<p><i>Even if</i> there is no one to share coffee with, and <i>even if</i> I'm in the awkward position of having access to electricity and drinking water, but not to coffee, I'd rather resort to another, let's say, more minimalist coffee-making method. Rather than giving an explanation, I have put the "Pakt Coffee Kit" and my solution side by side here: <a href="https://viewsync.net/watch?v=SMpmz4YL1Hw&t=0&v=D1PWXjTDKGE&t=0&mode=solo">viewsync.net/watch?v=SMpmz4YL1Hw&t=0&v=D1PWXjTDKGE&t=0&mode=solo</a> (<font color="red">play until right-hand video is finished</font>). It saves me time, 150 dollars, and, as a bonus, I barely have to do dishes afterwards.</p>

<p>Despite the strong wording of this post, I do not have anything against the Minimalists or against minimalists in general. In a world in which the ultra-rich buy private submarines and whatnot a portable coffee machine is relatively innocent. Rather, my point is that if we wish to relate critically to "consumer capitalism", it will not necessarily suffice to become "minimalists": minimalism, like most movements, is still subject to the same capitalist structures and forces it opposes. In my opininion, on a personal level the first step should be to clarify the line between needs and wants. Whole industries are built around needs; instead of soberly satisfying a need, they amplify it and make its satisfaction as hedonically appealing as the consumer can afford. The antidote is an emancipated contentment with a simple fulfillment of one's needs. It is <a href="https://cuboids.github.io/2020/01/14/introducing-isd.html">in the Buddha's teachings</a> that I have found inspiration for such contentment.</p>
