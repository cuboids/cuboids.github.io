<p>According to two people who call themselves "The Minimalists" we should buy the "Pakt Coffee Kit". Let's wind back a bit. What
do they mean with minimalism? From their website:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">
Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. . . .  Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.
. . . What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say, Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on 
what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.</blockquote>

<p>How wonderful! So you are telling me, an innocent deer ensnared in the trappings of consumer culture, that there is a way out?
And this way out starts with paying $15 for your book on minimalism and $150 for an "on-the-go" coffee machine? </p>
