<p>According to two people who call themselves "The Minimalists" we should buy the "Pakt Coffee Kit" (see <a href="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566510901/sltqcc7gewvbj9ux8hnx.png">here</a> for a picture). Let's wind back a bit. What do they mean with minimalism? From their website:</p>

<p><blockquote cite="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">
Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. . . .  Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.
</blockquote></p>  

<p>How wonderful! So you are telling me&mdash;an innocent deer ensnared in the trappings of consumer culture&mdash;that there is a way out? And this way out starts with paying $15 for your book on minimalism and $150 for an "on-the-go" coffee machine? Those are somehow "exempt" from the consumer culture you mention, despite their slick marketing? What about all the affiliate links in your YouTube
videos?</p>
  
<p>A bit further on, they write:</p>

<p><blockquote> What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say, <i>Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>That sounds great! Well, let me think. What's more meaningful, drinking a cup of coffee all alone, in unhappy, unfulfilled
isolation, or drinking with someone else, maybe a colleague or friend, or even a total stranger? I can see much more fulfillment in making new connections! How weird that the Pakt Coffee Kit can only make one cup of coffee at a time! I'm supposed to only care about myself? Is that what minimalism is about?</p>

<p><i>Even if</i> there is no one to share coffee with, and <i>even if</i> I'm in the very awkward position of having access to electricity and water, but not to coffee, I'd much rather use another method to make coffee. Rather than giving an explanation, I have put the Pakt Coffee Kit and my solution side by side here: <a href="https://bit.ly/3a7w12r">bit.ly/3a7w12r</a> (instructions: first click on "play" on both YouTube videos, then click play on the bottom compound video player). It saves me time, 150 dollars, and, as a bonus, time doing the dishes afterwards.</p>
