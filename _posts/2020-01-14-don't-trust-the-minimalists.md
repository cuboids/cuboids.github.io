<p>According to two people who call themselves "The Minimalists" we should buy the "Pakt Coffee Kit". Let's wind back a bit. What
do they mean with minimalism? From their website:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">
Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. . . .  Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.
</blockquote>  

<p>How wonderful! So you are telling me, an innocent deer ensnared in the trappings of consumer culture, that there is a way out?
And this way out starts with paying $15 for your book on minimalism and $150 for an "on-the-go" coffee machine? Those are somehow "exempt" from the consumer culture you mention, despite their slick marketing? What about all the affiliate links in your YouTube
videos?</p>
  
<p>A bit further on they write:</p>

<blockquote> What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say, <i>Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.</i></blockquote>

<p>That sounds wonderful! Well, let me think. What's more meaningful, drinking a cup of coffee all alone, in unhappy, unfulfilled
isolation, or drinking with someone else, maybe a colleague or friend, or even a total stranger? I can see much more fulfillment in making new connections! How weird that the Pakt Coffee Kit can only make one cup of coffee at a time! I'm supposed to only care about myself? Is that what minimalism is about?</p>

<p><i>Even if</i> there is no one to share coffee with, and <i>even if</i> I'm in the very awkward position of having access to electricity and water, but not to coffee, I'd much rather use another method to make coffee. Rather than explaining this method, I have shown them side by side here: <a href="https://bit.ly/3a7w12r">bit.ly/3a7w12r</a> (instructions: first click "play" in both YouTube videos, then click play on the bottom compound video player). As a bonus, it saves me dishes, time, and 150 dollars!</p>
