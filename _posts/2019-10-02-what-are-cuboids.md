<p>Cuboids can be considered blog posts. But that doesn't exhaust their meaning. The subtitle of <i>luminouscuboids</i> reads "Dhamma and Life": with this website I'd like to partly explore the meaning of <i>dhamma</i> (<i>hō</i> in Japanese, <i>beop</i> in Korean, 法—pronounced fǎ—in Mandarin, <i>dharma</i> in Sanskrit, <i>chö</i> in Tibetan, and <i>pháp</i> in Vietnamese) and relate this exploration to "Life", with which I mean my experience and that of others. This does not mean that the purpose of <i>luminouscuboids</i> includes proselytizing or its cousin, advertising; it includes neither. Though I have many outstanding intellectual and non-intellectual debts, I do not consider myself beholden to any intellectual or non-intellectual system of thought.</p>

<p>One debt worth mentioning is that to Mark Rothko, who's oeuvre inspired the notion of a "luminous cuboid". Unlike a hyperrealist, I do not intend to paint a detailed portrait of reality. Rather, cuboids intend to shed light one some topics of interest while preferring brevity over digression, content over style, and a minimum viable cuboid over a perfect one. Indeed, <i>luminouscuboids</i> does not cater to a gratification-seeking audience with a short attention span; neither does it seek popularity or fame. Rather, it aims to serve the modest goal of "just being there", floating somewhere in the far outskirts of the blogosphere, welcoming any visitor it might receive. With that, I hope to have said enough to get started.</p>
