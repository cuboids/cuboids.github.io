Cuboids can be considered blog posts. But that doesn't exhaust their meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary entry for "blog" gives:

<blockquote>"A frequently updated website, typically run by a single person and consisting of personal observations arranged in chronological order, excerpts from other sources, hyperlinks to other sites, etc.; an online journal or diary"<br>
<b>Source</b> "blog, n.". OED Online. September 2019. Oxford University Press.
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. Yet the general definition above doesn't tell us what kind of blog <i>luminouscuboids</i> wishes to become. The subtitle reads "Dhamma and Life": with <i>luminouscuboids</i> I'd like to partly explore the meaning of "Dhamma" ("Dharma" in Sanskrit) and relate this exploration to "Life", with which I mean my experience and that of others. This does not mean that the purpose of <i>luminouscuboids</i> includes proselytizing or its cousin, advertising; it includes neither. Though I have manifold outstanding intellectual and non-intellectual debts, I do not consider myself beholden to any intellectual or non-intellectual system of thought.</p>

<p>One debt worth mentioning is that to Mark Rothko, who's oeuvre inspired the notion of a "luminous cuboid". Unlike a hyperrealist, I do not intend to paint a detailed portrait of reality. Rather, cuboids intend to shed light one some topics of interest while preferring brevity over digression, content over style, and a minimum viable cuboid over a perfect one. Indeed, <i>luminouscuboids</i> does not cater to a gratification-seeking audience with a short attention span; neither does it seek popularity or fame. Rather, it aims to serve the modest goal of "just being there", floating somewhere in the far outskirts of the blogosphere, welcoming any visitor it might receive. With that, I hope to have said enough to get started.</p>
