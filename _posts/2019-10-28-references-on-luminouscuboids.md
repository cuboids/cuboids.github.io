<p>Image source: <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-06-candidate-dark.html">Science X/Zarija Lukic/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> + <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/">Deep Dream Generator</a>. To make referencing earlier blog posts easier, I have decided to give each blog post a unique PageLink address (a shortened URL). For example, this post has as its PageLink address <a href="https://cuboids.page.link/pagelink">cuboids.page.link/pagelink</a>.</p>

<p>In some of my posts I also use shortDOIs to reference journal articles. They are usually of the format 10/abcd and can be resolved by going to https://doi.org/abcd or by using the DOI resolver at https://doi.org.</p>
