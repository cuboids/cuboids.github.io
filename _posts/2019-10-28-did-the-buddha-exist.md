<p>How can we know if the Buddha existed as a historical person? One answer: we can consult the field of Buddhist Studies.
Recently there has been some debate about the matter in this field. David Drewes argued that "no basis for treating the Buddha as a historical figure has yet been identified" (Drewes 2017, 1). This view is not uncontroversial. I'd like to mention three replies to Drewes (2017): Wynne (2019), Levman (2019), and von Hinüber (forthcoming), cited in Dhammadinnā (2018, 303n55) (see <a href="https://cuboids.page.link/paywalls">cuboids.page.link/paywalls</a> for how to access paywalled articles).</p>

<p>I will leave it to the reader to make up their own minds; however, in line with the articles by Wynne, Levman, and von Hinüber, and considering Sujato & Brahmali (2015), in further blog posts I will assume that (<i>i</i>) the Buddha was a historical person and (<i>ii</i>) it is possible to know about his life, e.g. by consulting works such as Gombrich (2009).
