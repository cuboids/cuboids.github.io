<p>How can we know if the Buddha existed as a historical person? One answer: we can consult the field of Buddhist Studies.
Recently there has been some debate about the matter in this field. David Drewes argued that "no basis for treating the Buddha as a historical figure has yet been identified" (Drewes 2017, 1). This view is not uncontroversial. I'd like to mention three replies to Drewes (2017): Wynne (2019), Levman (2019), and von Hinüber (forthcoming).
