<p>With <i>Illuminated Sutta Discovery</i> I'd like to follow the example of Piya Tan, who created the <a href="http://www.themindingcentre.org/dharmafarer/sutta-discovery/"> Sutta Discovery (SD) series</a> in 2002. What I like most most about Sutta Discovery is Piya's thematic approach to the suttas.  In this series of blog posts, I'd like to preserve some of the skeleton of Sutta Discovery while changing the flesh and skin. Crucially, I'd like to add <i>luminosity</i> to Sutta Discovery: a clarity which may inspire others to practice the Dhamma.<p>
