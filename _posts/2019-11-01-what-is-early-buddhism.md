<p>Pictured: the burning of Sardis during the Ionian Revolt in 498 BCE. <b>Early Buddhism</b> refers to the earliest period in the history of Buddhism, from about the 5th to the 3rd century BCE (Analayo 2012*, esp. p243n60;
quoted in, e.g., Analayo 2019†, p. 2341; i.e. the Buddhism between the Ionian Revolt and the instigation of the Second Macedonian War). I will have to say more about both papers later.</p>

<p>Now that I defined early Buddhism, it may be a good time to share an introduction to the early Buddhist thought world. I would highly recommend <a href="https://amzn.com/1928706983">Excursions into the Thought-world of the Pāli Discourses</a>, which is also freely available online in two volumes: <a href="https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/from-craving.pdf">the first</a> and <a href="https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/from-grasping.pdf">the second</a>.</p>
