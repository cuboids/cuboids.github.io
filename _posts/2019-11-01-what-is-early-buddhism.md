<p>Pictured: the burning of Sardis during the Ionian Revolt in 498 BCE. <b>Early Buddhism</b> refers to the earliest period in the history of Buddhism, from about the 5th to the 3rd century BCE (Analayo 2012*, esp. p243n60;
quoted in Analayo 2019†, p. 2341; i.e. the Buddhism between the Ionian Revolt and the instigation of the Second Macedonian War). I will have to say more about both papers later.</p>
