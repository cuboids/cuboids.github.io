<p>Early Buddhism refers to the earliest period in the history of Buddhism, from about the 5th to the 3rd century BCE (Analayo 2012*;
quoted in Analayo 2019†, p. 2341; i.e. the Buddhism between the Ionian Revolt and the instigation of the Second Macedonian War). I will have to say more about both papers later.</p>
