<p>Intellectual property poses interesting questions regarding its ethical justification, as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/">its entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> shows. I would like to share some techniques for finding the full contents of books and journal articles online. In doing so I firmly suspend value judgements regarding intellectual property. The reader may use these techniques as she sees fit.</p>

<p>Z-library contains, according to its own statistics, close to five million books and over seventy-five million journal articles&mdash;all freely accessible. Its URL is https://b-ok.org or alternatively https://b-ok.xyz. </p>
