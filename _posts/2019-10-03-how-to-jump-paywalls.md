<p>Intellectual property poses interesting questions regarding its ethical justification, as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/">its entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> shows. I would like to share some techniques for finding the full contents of books and journal articles online. In doing so I firmly suspend value judgements regarding intellectual property. The reader may use these techniques as she sees fit. (Note that the information below could easily be outdated by the time you read this.)</p>

<p>Z-library contains, according to its own statistics, close to five million ebooks and over seventy-five million journal articles&mdash;all freely accessible. Its URLs include the redirection page https://z-lib.org, https://b-ok.org or https://b-ok.xyz for ebooks, and https://booksc.org/ and https://booksc.xyz/ for articles. Though not necessary, a free account allows users to see past downloads, save books, get personalized recommendations, and set up ZAlerts which give notifications if new books corresponding to the search query become available on Z-library.</p>

<p>Sometimes ebooks on Z-library have been deleted by the uploader. In that case it can pay off to visit <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Library_Genesis">Library Genesis</a> (now at https://gen.lib.rus.ec) to check if they have a copy of the ebook.</p>

<p>If an article cannot be found on Z-library one might try <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a>, now at https://sci-hub.tw. For current mirrors, see https://whereisscihub.now.sh/.</p>
