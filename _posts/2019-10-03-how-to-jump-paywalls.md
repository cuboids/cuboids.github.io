<p>Intellectual property poses interesting questions regarding its ethical justification, as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/">its entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> shows. I would like to share some techniques for finding the full contents of books and journal articles online. In doing so I firmly suspend value judgements regarding intellectual property. The reader may use these techniques as she sees fit. (Note that the information below could easily be outdated by the time you read this.)</p>

<p>Somtimes a simple Google search for <pre>[book or article name] filetype:pdf</pre> will work. But often it won't.</p>

<p>Z-library contains, according to its own statistics, close to five million ebooks and over seventy-five million journal articles&mdash;all freely accessible. Its URLs include (a) the redirection page <a href="https://z-lib.org">https://z-lib.org</a>, (b) <a href="https://b-ok.org">https://b-ok.org</a> aor <a href="https://b-ok.xyz">https://b-ok.xyz</a> for ebooks, and (c) <a href="https://booksc.org/">https://booksc.org/</a> or <a href="https://booksc.xyz/">https://booksc.xyz/</a> for articles. Though not necessary, a free account allows users to see past downloads, save books, get personalized recommendations, and set up ZAlerts which give notifications if new books corresponding to the search query become available on Z-library.</p>

<p>Sometimes ebooks on Z-library have been deleted by the uploader. In that case it can pay off to visit <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Library_Genesis">Library Genesis</a> (now at <a href="https://gen.lib.rus.ec">https://gen.lib.rus.ec</a>) to check if they have a copy of the ebook. PDF Drive (<a href="https://pdfdrive.com">https://pdfdrive.com</a>) also has many ebooks.</p>

<p>If an article cannot be found on Z-library one might try <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a>, now at <a href="https://sci-hub.tw">https://sci-hub.tw</a>. For current mirrors, see <a href="https://whereisscihub.now.sh/">https://whereisscihub.now.sh/</a>.</p>

<p>Let me conclude with some remarks concerning reading ebooks. My go-to tool for file conversions remains <a href="https://cloudconvert.com">CloudConvert</a>: fast, reliable, powerful, and no-nonsense. I use Google Drive and Google Books for saving and reading ebooks; I'm especially happy with Google Book's feature of saving one's progress (YMMV).
