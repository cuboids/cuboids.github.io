Intellectual property poses interesting questions regarding its ethical justification. (A quick Google search for credible books about copyright yields <cite>Infringement Nation: Copyright 2.0 and You</cite> and <cite>Authors, Users, and Pirates: Copyright Law and Subjectivity</cite> among many others.) This post lists some techniques for finding the full contents of books and journal articles online. However, I do not commit to any value judgements regarding intellectual property; the reader may use these techniques at her discretion, or decide not use them at all. In no case will I, Chung van Gog, or this website, luminouscuboids, be liable for any damages resulting from applying the methods sketched in this cuboid. The title of this blog post is not intended to promote any particular or other kind of behavior or action.

Some legal resources for finding journal articles can be found here: [Resources for Finding and Accessing Scientific Papers](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/competitions/finding-and-accessing-scientific-papers).

Sometimes a simple Google search for <code><strong>[book or article name] filetype:pdf</strong></code> will work. But usually it will fail.

Z-library contains about five million ebooks and 75 million journal articles, all freely accessible. Its URLs include (a) the redirection page [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org), (b) [Electronic Library (1a)](https://b-ok.org) or [Electronic Library (1b)](https://b-ok.xyz) for ebooks, and (&#99;) [Electronic Library (2a)](https://booksc.org) or [Electronic Library (2b)](https://booksc.xyz) for articles. A free account allows you to see your past downloads, save books, get personal recommendations, and set up [ZAlerts](https://th.b-ok2.org/blog/5), which notiy you when a new book becomes available.

Sometimes ebooks on Z-library have been deleted. In that case you can try [Library Genesis](https://wikiwand.com/en/Library_Genesis), now at [Library Genesis]https://gen.lib.rus.ec</a>, to check if they have a copy. <a href="https://pdfdrive.com">PDF Drive</a> also has some ebooks.

If an article cannot be found on Z-library then there's <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a>, now at <a href="https://sci-hub.tw">https://sci-hub.tw</a>. For current mirrors, see <a href="https://whereisscihub.now.sh/">https://whereisscihub.now.sh/</a>.

For file conversions I usually use <a href="https://cloudconvert.com">CloudConvert</a>. I use Google Drive and Google Books for saving and reading ebooks, but there are many options. Google Books and Amazon's preview feature can provide access to parts of books. And many older books can be found on archive.org.
