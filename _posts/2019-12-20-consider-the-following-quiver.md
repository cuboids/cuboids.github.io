<p>Here I'd like to share one way to conceptualize onself and others which I found useful.</p> 

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/deepmath.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>

<img src="{{ 'assets/images/helping.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" />

<p>In the diagram above, each arrow indicates a "helping" relation. Helping can include a lot of actions: from donating
to a charity, to making a cup of tea for oneself, to attentively listening to someone else. I drew the diagram in this
way because of an important principle which frequent flyers will now: in case of emergency, first put on your own
oxygen mask, only then help others put on theirs. I think this principle generalizes: first make sure you adequately help yourself (beta), and only then help the other beings (alpha) or specific other people (gamma). You will be in a much better position to reach out after first taking care of yourself. Failure to do so is what I call <i>beta-deficiency</i>: a lack of self-care which risks negative health and well-being outcomes.</p>

<p>* A quiver is a nice mathematical structure which more or less captures the structure of the diagram I made. But it won't
be necessary to go into that.</p>
