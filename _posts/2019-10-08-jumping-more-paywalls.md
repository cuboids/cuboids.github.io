<p>In <a href="https://cuboids.github.io/2019/10/03/how-to-jump-paywalls.html">the previous post</a> one of us showed how to find (otherwise paywalled) articles and books online. Here we will share one method (out of many) to avoid movie paywalls. This method assumes the watcher is comfortable with double Chinese-English subtitles; non-Chinese speaking viewers may simply ignore the Chinese subs.</p>

<p>First, we recommend using an adblocker such as <a href="http://www.standsapp.org/">Fair Adblocker</a> to prevent accidental clicking any hyperlinks on the websites which host the movies. Optionally, one may wish to use a VPN.</p>

<h3>Streaming movies</h3>
<p>The key words of this method are 在线 (Pinyin: zai'xian), which means "online". You can simply input <pre>[Movie name in English] + 在线</pre> in Google to find websites which host the movie. If you'd like to be more thorough, try <pre>([Movie name in English] OR [Movie name in simplified Chinese]) + 在线</pre>. The simplified Chinese name of a movie can be found by finding the movie on Wikipedia (try <pre>[Movie title in English] + site:zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn</pre>) and copy-pasting the Chinese movie title.</p>

<p>For instance, you want to watch "Inception". So you input <pre>(Inception OR 盗梦空间)在线</pre>. in google search. Then all kinds of shady websites appear on the screen. You can just start trying by simply clicking the links. The first result is haitum and we click it...humm usually haitum works good but somehow it is too slow to load in my laptop. Plus, it seems that they only have Chinese subtitles since we see 中字 (it means Chinese subtitles). Usually you can try different mirrors in there which are indicated as 线路一, 线路二...(route one, route two..) but we gonna try the second link in Google. So we click duonaolive and the button under the tag 线路1 and somehow you need to activate your flash player and the movie starts! Drag the time bar to some time later and to check if there are English subs...seems like there is! Mission accomplished! 

And if you didn't get any luck after one or two clicks, just continue. Usually haitum, duonaolive, wandouys, zxzjs, 91mjw are all solid ones. 91mjw is focused on American shows and movies. So if you use google translate to translate this website and you are basically in the heaven of free American shows and movies. Usually the English subtitles are included and the quality is top-notch. And if sometimes you see 中英双字 (Chinese and English subtitiles), you are guarenteed to watch if you don't mind the Chinese subs! And if you didn't find any above-mentioned websites, just try other ones listed in Google search.
