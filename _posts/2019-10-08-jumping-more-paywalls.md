<p>In <a href="https://cuboids.github.io/2019/10/03/how-to-jump-paywalls.html">the previous post</a> one of us showed how to find (otherwise paywalled) articles and books online. Here we will share one method (out of many) to avoid movie paywalls. This method assumes the watcher is comfortable with double Chinese-English subtitles; non-Chinese speaking viewers may simply ignore the Chinese subs.</p>

<p>First, we recommend using an adblocker such as <a href="http://www.standsapp.org/">Fair Adblocker</a> to prevent accidental clicking any hyperlinks on the websites which host the movies.</p>

<h2>Streaming movies</h2>
<p>The key words of this method are 在线 (Pinyin: zai'xian), which means "online". You can simply input <pre>[Movie name in English] + 在线</pre> in Google to find websites which host the movie. More results may be found by inputting <pre>([Movie name in English] OR [Movie name in simplified Chinese]) + 在线</pre>. The simplified Chinese name of a movie can be found by finding the movie on Wikipedia, changing the language to simplified Chinese for China, and copy-pasting the Chinese movie title.
