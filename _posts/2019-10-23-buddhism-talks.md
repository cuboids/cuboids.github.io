What is dharma, the teaching, without dharma talks, talks about the teaching? Impoverished. As a Buddhist practicioner, it helps to have a reliable supply of dharma talks. I recommend those by the [Buddhist Society of Western Australia (BSWA)](https://youtube.com/channel/UC6M_EhnSSdTG_SXUp6IAWmQ). They are live streamed every Friday; guided meditations are streamed every Friday and Saturday; sutta classes every other Sunday.

But what kind of dharma talks does the BSWA stream? It's hard to say. There are influences of both TheravƒÅda orthodoxy and Buddhist modernism, but a more important influence seems to be early Buddhism ([What is Early Buddhism?](cuboids.page.link/eb)). Yet, I think it's the experience of the mendicant speakers which really counts. I have met some of them and I have no doubt they walk the walk. I have included an example dharma talk below
