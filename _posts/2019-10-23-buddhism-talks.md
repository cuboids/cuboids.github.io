<p>For anyone interested in Buddhism, last week the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6M_EhnSSdTG_SXUp6IAWmQ">Buddhist Society of Western Australia</a> resumed streaming their  regular talks and mediation sessions on YouTube (their annual Rains Retreat [<i>Vassa</i>] having finished last week).</p>

<p>Forthcoming (Oct 2019 - mid-July 2020) are around 37 short meditation sessions (25-30 min) followed by a 45-60 min talk 
each Friday (19:30 <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/awst">Australian Western Standard Time (AWST)</a> = 19:30 UTC +8), 37 long meditation sessions (40-45 min) preceded by a short talk about a specific aspect of meditation (10-15 min) each Saturday (15:00 AWST), and about 19 sutta classes (60-90 min) every other week (?) on Sunday (14:00 AWST). All for free. :).</p>
