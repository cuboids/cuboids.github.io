<p>What is dharma, the teaching, without dharma talks, talks about the teaching? Impoverished. As a Buddhist practicioner, it helps to have a reliable supply of dharma talks. I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6M_EhnSSdTG_SXUp6IAWmQ">those by the Buddhist Society of Western Australia (BSWA)</a>. They are live streamed every Friday; guided meditations are streamed every Friday and Saturday; sutta classes every other Sunday.</p>

<p>But what kind of dharma talks does the BSWA stream? It's hard to say. There are influences of both TheravƒÅda orthodoxy and Buddhist modernism, but a more important influence is early Buddhism (<a href="https://cuboids.page.link/eb">cuboids.page.link/eb</a>). Yet, most important is the experience the mendicants bring to the talks.</p>
