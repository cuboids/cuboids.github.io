<p>What is dharma, the teaching, without dharma talks, talks about the teaching? Impoverished. As a Buddhist practicioner, it helps to have a reliable supply of dharma talks. I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6M_EhnSSdTG_SXUp6IAWmQ">those by the Buddhist Society of Western Australia</a>. They are live streamed every Friday; guided meditations are streamed every Friday and Saturday; sutta classes every other Sunday.</p>
