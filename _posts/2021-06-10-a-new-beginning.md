<p>It is time for a new beginning. Let’s start with a single book: <i>Science on a Mission (2021)</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What difference does it make who pays for science?</p>
<p>Some might say none. If scientists seek to discover fundamental truths about the world, and they do so in an objective manner using well-established methods, then how could it matter who’s footing the bill? History, however, suggests otherwise. In science, as elsewhere, money is power. Tracing the recent history of oceanography, Naomi Oreskes discloses dramatic changes in American ocean science since the Cold War, uncovering how and why it changed. Much of it has to do with who pays.</p>
<p>After World War II, the US military turned to a new, uncharted theater of warfare: the deep sea. The earth sciences—particularly physical oceanography and marine geophysics—became essential to the US Navy, who poured unprecedented money and logistical support into their study. <em>Science on a Mission</em> brings to light how this influx of military funding was both enabling and constricting: it resulted in the creation of important domains of knowledge but also significant, lasting, and consequential domains of ignorance.</p>
<p>As Oreskes delves into the role of patronage in the history of science, what emerges is a vivid portrait of how naval oversight transformed what we know about the sea. It is a detailed, sweeping history that illuminates the ways funding shapes the subject, scope, and tenor of scientific work, and it raises profound questions about the purpose and character of American science. What difference does it make who pays? The short answer is: a lot. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Mission-Military-Funding-Shaped/dp/022673238X">source</a>)</p>

<p>And I’d also like to mention a mesmerizing opera I discovered today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se9cBFbLDJc"><i>The Eigth Hour of Amduat</i></a> (2017). Some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This opera for mezzosoprano, choir, improvising soloists, orchestra and electronics, and featuring the leader of the Sun Ra Arkestra, Marshall Allen on alto saxophone and electronics, is adapted from the earliest surviving illustrated book and sound score, The Book of the Amduat, painted on walls in the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and many papyri. We use the version in Tuthmose III’s tomb, who ruled Egypt from 1485-1431 BC. He is widely thought to be the Pharaoh of Exodus: if it wasn’t him, it was a close relative. He co-ruled at first with the female Pharaoh, Hatsepsut, and was great grandfather to Akhenaten. He built the obelisks known as Cleopatra’s Needle, one of which is on the Thames in London, and the other is near East 81st street in Central Park in New York City.</p>
<p>Each morning, Sun Ra emerges from a hole in the east and sails on a river through our sky. After he descends he continue from west to east on the river through the underworld, the Amudat, to reemerge in the morning. Each night he dies, but is reborn in the 6th night hour when he unites with Osiris and defeats the serpent, Apep.</p>
<p>The piece takes place during the 8th hour of the night, Mistress of deep night, in the city of the 8th hour, Sarcophagus of her gods. Sun Ra and his companions on the boat are being hauled by a choir on the underworld river. During the hour they are clothed and encounter other gods who live in ten caverns along the shore, along with living knives who defeat their enemies and four sacred rams. By earliest sound score, we mean that the specific sounds from each group of gods in each cavern of the city are described quite literally during the trip.
