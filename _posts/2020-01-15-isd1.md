### Introduction
This is the first installment of *Illuminated Sutta Discovery* (see [cuboids.page.link/isd](https://cuboids.page.link/isd)). Here we'll look at the historical Buddha ([cuboids.page.link/buddha](https://cuboids.page.link/buddha)) and some of his teachings. We'll accomplish this by reading some important suttas from the *Suttapiṭaka*.
### Turning the Dharma Wheel

#### Context
After the Buddha attained awakening under the Bodhi tree, and decided to teach, he thought about to whom he should teach the path to awakening. As his two former meditation teachers had recently passed away, he decided he should teach his five former companions with whom he used to practice asceticism. These five had left him when he had given up that practice. The Buddha set out on foot to Isipatana, a journey of more than 240 kilometers. After arriving, he convinced his former companions that he had reached supreme sanctuary&mdash;despite having abandoned self-mortification. The Buddha then delivered the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta* (the Pali name of *Turning the Dharma Wheel*).

#### Summary
The first discourse of the Buddha, taught at the Isipatana Deer Park to the group of five seekers. It begins by rejecting the extremes of punishing the body and seeking sensual pleasures and recommends the middle way of the noble eightfold path. Then it defines the four noble truths and analyzes them. It ends with Venerable Kondañña becoming the first person after the Buddha to realize the Dharma. <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://buddhasgrove.blogspot.com/p/turning-dharma-wheel.html">Read *Turning the Dharma Wheel*</a>, or listen to this sutta:

#### Going deeper
For deepening one's understanding of the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*, I would recommend [the following master class by Venerable Brahmavamso](https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-cfk9v-901ed8). See also 10/djh4 (<a href="https://cuboids.page.link/references">cuboids.page.link/references</a>), a short encyclopedia article on this sutta. For alternative translations and more, see [cuboids.page.link/sn56-11](https://cuboids.page.link/sn56-11).

### Not Self
The second discourse of the Buddha, also taught at the Isipatana Deer park, to the group of five seekers. This teaching is about "not self". <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://buddhasgrove.blogspot.com/p/not-self.html">Read *Not Self*</a>.
