<p><h3>Turning the Dharma Wheel</h3></p>

<p>The first discourse of the Buddha, taught at the Isipatana Deer Park to the group of five seekers. It begins by rejecting the extremes of punishing the body and seeking sensual pleasures and recommends the middle way of the noble eightfold path. Then it defines the four noble truths and analyzes them. It ends with Venerable Kondañña becoming the first person after the Buddha to realize the Dharma. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/buddhasgrove/suttas/turning-the-dharma-wheel">Read <i>Turning the Dharma Wheel</i></a>, or listen to this sutta:</p>
