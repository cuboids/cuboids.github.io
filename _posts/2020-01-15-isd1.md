<h2>Turning the Dharma Wheel</h2>

<blockquote>The first discourse of the Buddha, taught at the Isipatana Deer park to the group of five seekers. 
It begins by rejecting the extremes of punishing the body and seeking sensual pleasures and recommends the middle way of the 
noble eightfold path. Then it defines the four noble truths.. It ends with Venerable Kondañña becoming the first person after
the Buddha to realize the Dhamma.
