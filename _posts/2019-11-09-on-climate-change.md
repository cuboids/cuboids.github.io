<p>I find it virtually impossible not to drown in all the (mis/dis)information about climate change. But I doubt if my lack of
understanding justifies remaining silent on the topic. That's why I'd like to share one journal article, published in a reputable
journal, which seems to provide a good primer on climate change: 10/ddxk.</p>
