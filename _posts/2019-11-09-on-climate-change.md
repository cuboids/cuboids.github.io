<p>Here I'd like to share an open access journal article about climate change: <a href="https://doi.org/ddxk">10/ddxk</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/">Skeptical Science</a>, an informative website about climate science and its deniers. (For more, see e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/nclimate/">Nature Climate Change</a>.) </p>
