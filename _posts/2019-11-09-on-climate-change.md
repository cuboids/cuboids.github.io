<p>Here I'd like to share two open access journal articles. One is about climate change, the other about climate denial: <a href="https://doi.org/ddxk">10/ddxk</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/ggfkvr">10/ggfkvr</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/">Skeptical Science</a>, an informative website about climate science and its deniers. (For more, see, e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/nclimate/">Nature Climate Change</a> and the HarvardX course <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/climate-energy-challenge-0?delta=0">The Climate-Energy Challenge</a>. If you'd like to dive deep into the research, check out <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/">IPCC's reports</a>.) </p>
