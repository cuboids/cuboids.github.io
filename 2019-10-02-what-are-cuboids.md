Cuboids are small and irregularly updated blog posts. The subtitle of luminouscuboids reads "Dhamma and Life": it's about the *dhamma* (*hō* in Japanese, *beop* in Korean, 法—pronounced fǎ—in Mandarin, *dharma* in Sanskrit, *chö* in Tibetan, and *pháp* in Vietnamese) and about "life", my experience and that of others. Cuboids let you believe what you already want to believe and buy whatever you already want to buy: they're free from advertisements and ideological interpolations.

I tip my hat to Mark Rothko, who's oeuvre inspired the notion of a "luminous cuboid". Unlike a hyperrealist, I do not paint a detailed portrait of reality. Rather, cuboids shed light on interesting topics while preferring brevity over digression, content over style, and a "minimum viable cuboid" over a perfect one. Luminouscuboids serves the modest goal of simply existing, floating in the outskirts of blogospheric cyberspace, welcoming any visitor it receives.
