Here we'll take a deeper look at the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*. The first thing to note is that the original sutta is in Pāli, the Middle-Indo Aryan language we find in the Pali Canon (for an introduction to Pāli, see Gombrich (2019)). The translation at [The Buddha and the Early Buddhist Teachings](https://cuboids.page.link/isd1) is from Javier Fernandez-Viña, who so far translated about a dozen-and-a-half suttas from the Pali Canon.
