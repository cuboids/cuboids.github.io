Here we'll take a deeper look at the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*. The first thing to note is that the original sutta is in Pāli, the Middle-Indo Aryan language we find in the Pali Canon. If you'd like to know more about this language, I would recommend Gombrich (2019).

I generated the audio files with Google's Text-to-Speech API.

The benchmark translations, however, are those by Bhikkhu Sujato. I might write a seperate blog post about his 2015-ongoing translation project of the early portions of the Pali Canon later, but here I'll simply link to [Sujato's 2018 (revised) translation of the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta* at SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato) and [the accompanying audio recordings at SuttaCentral Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net/scv/index.html#/sutta?search=sn56.11&lang=en). Whereas Fernandez-Viña uses dynamic equivalence, Sujato
