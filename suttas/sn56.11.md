### Introduction and Alternative Translations

Here we'll take a deeper look at the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*. The first thing to note is that the original sutta is in Pāli, the Middle-Indo Aryan language we find in the Pali Canon. If you'd like to know more about this language, I would recommend Gombrich (2019). The translation at [The Buddha and the Early Buddhist Teachings](https://cuboids.page.link/isd1) is from Javier Fernandez-Viña, who so far translated about a dozen-and-a-half suttas from the Pali Canon into English. His approach relies on [dynamic equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence) and on [plain language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_language), which felt quite refreshing to me: the suttas tend to be repetitive and many translations use archaic terminology. I generated the audio files with Google's Text-to-Speech API.

The benchmark translations, however, are those by Bhikkhu Sujato. I might write a seperate blog post about his 2015-ongoing translation project of the early portions of the Pali Canon later, but here I'll simply link to [Sujato's 2018 (revised) translation of the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta* at SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato) and [the accompanying audio at SuttaCentral Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net/scv/index.html#/sutta?search=sn56.11&lang=en). Whereas Fernandez-Viña relies on dynamic equivalence, Sujato's translations are more precise and preserve the structure of the source texts. For more on the structure of the <abbr title="Early Buddhist Texts">EBTs</abbr>, cf. Anālayo (2007).

### Parallels

One of the most exciting facts about the EBTs is that many of them have parallels. This means we can compare the different versions and figure out which parts are likely authentic and which were added later. The *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta* has many parallels, one of them being the *Mahākhandhaka*, preserved in the Theravāda Vinaya, which not only contains a parallel to the Buddha's first discourse, but also to his second and third—"Not Self" and "On Fire". A translation by Bhikkhu Brahmali is forthcoming
