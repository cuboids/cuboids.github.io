### Introduction and Alternative Translations

Here we'll take a deeper look at the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta*. The first thing to note is that the original sutta is in Pāli, the Middle-Indo Aryan language we find in the Pali Canon. If you'd like to know more about this language, I would recommend Gombrich (2019). The translation at [The Buddha and the Early Buddhist Teachings](https://cuboids.page.link/isd1) is from Javier Fernandez-Viña, who so far translated about a dozen-and-a-half suttas from the Pali Canon into English. His approach relies on [dynamic equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence) and on [plain language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_language), which felt quite refreshing to me: the suttas tend to be repetitive and many translations use archaic terminology. I generated the audio files with Google's Text-to-Speech API.

The benchmark translations, however, are those by Bhikkhu Sujato. I might write a seperate blog post about his 2015-ongoing translation project of the early portions of the Pali Canon later, but here I'll simply link to [Sujato's 2018 (revised) translation of the *Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta* at SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato) and [the accompanying audio at SuttaCentral Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net/scv/index.html#/sutta?search=sn56.11&lang=en). Whereas Fernandez-Viña relies on dynamic equivalence, Sujato's translations are more precise and preserve the structure of the source texts. For more on the structure of the <abbr title="Early Buddhist Texts">EBTS</abbr>, cf. Anālayo (2007). Most people with knowledge about the suttas, however, will be familiar with translations by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1993) and Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003).
